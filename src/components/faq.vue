          Since we make each portrait individually for you and your darling, the production time is 3-5 working days. We want to take our time for every single picture in order to be able to capture even small details. But as they say - anticipation is the most beautiful joy ‚ù§

          If you decide to buy a high quality art print, you will receive it within 4-8 working days.

          If you decide to buy our blanket, you will receive it within 8-12 working days.

          We send the art print as well as the ceiling as DHL or DPD parcel.
